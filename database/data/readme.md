# Data

This folder is for re-runnable data scripts. Re-runnable data scripts are most common for List of Value (LOV) / lookup tables. This allows developers to easily manage the LOV data rather than end users. It also prevents having to manually write updates each time one is required. It is recommended to name each file `data_table_name.sql`. When opening files in VSCode using the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_quick-open) you can quickly find `data` scripts

> Note: other modern text editors might have similar functionality.
